Domain modeling of Mathematical sets.

This repository contains three alternatives to recursive Set construction:

1. Object-oriented form using Set elements
2. Sum-type form ("successor-terminus")
3. Mixed OO and sum-type form

Form 3) allows simultanenous traversal as an object hierarchy or a sum-type tree.

Tests include examples of constructions and corresponding pattern-matching expressions.
